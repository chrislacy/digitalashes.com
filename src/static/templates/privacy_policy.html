      <h2>Digital Ashes Privacy Policy</h2>

      <div id="landingPageDescrip" style="padding-top:10px">
        <p><strong>Version 1.0</strong></p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:10px;"><strong>Effective on February 24, 2014</strong></p>
        <p>This privacy statement describes how <strong>Digital Ashes PTY. LTD.</strong> (Digital Ashes) collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <div class="ppSectionHeader">Overview</div>
        <p>Digital Ashes is in the business of selling applications. It is absolutely not in the business of selling personal information about our users.</p>

        <p>We believe the best way to ensure your private information is protected is to make every effort to ensure we are never in possession of your private information in the first place.</p>
      <br /><br />

      <div class="ppSectionHeader">Collection and Use</div>
      <p><strong>We may collect the following personal information from you:</strong></p>

        <li>Device Information and IP address.</li>

        <li>Inform you about other Digital Ashes products.</li>
        <li>Inform you about policy changes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We believe the best way for a product/service to keep your private data private is to avoid handling it altogether. We strive to do this whenever possible. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, applications by Digital Ashes do not transfer any private or personal information from your device(s). </p>

        <li>If Digital Ashes is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
