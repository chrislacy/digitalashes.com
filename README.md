digitalashes.com
================

The full source code for [digitalashes.com][1]. Because independent developers have better things to do than piss about writing company websites.

Currently contains the following pages:
* Index (I list all my apps, and link to where to get them)
* About
* Contact
* Page not found
* Privacy Policy
* Terms of Service

A note of the legal pages
-------------------------

My Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are included in this release, but I make absolutely no guarantees as to the legal suitability of these documents for your own usage.

Usage
-----

This website is built to run on [Google App Engine] using the Python 2.7 runtime.

To deploy this application yourself, create an App Engine project and change the `application` identifier in `app.yaml`, and you're good to go (hint: if you're starting out, use the GoogleAppEngineLauncher app that comes with the [SDK][3] and `Add existing`).


Contributions
-------------

If you are skilled with web development and would like to improve this project, I would certainly welcome any and all help in this regard.

The most obvious area lacking at the moment are detailed product pages for individual apps (Link Bubble and Action Launcher are the more important apps).
